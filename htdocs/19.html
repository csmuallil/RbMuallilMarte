      The album is named "19" to represent what age she was when she wrote the songs. She wrote three different cuts for the LP record in 2006. The rest of the album was finished in only 3 weeks after her relationship with her second boyfriend went downhill. “When I couldn’t write a song for so long, I tried to make up things and I tried to write fictional songs or write things about other people’s situation, but I never could ‘cause I don’t believe what I’m singing” (Adele, 2008) Adele said during an interview with German press. “I can’t be convincing or sincere when I don’t feel what I’m singing” (Adele 2008).</p>

    <p>
The first single that was released from the album is “Hometown Glory”. Fun fact! The big piano ballad was written in just 10 minutes when she was only 15 years old. It’s actually her first song that she wrote. After finding a few R&B and soul chart-toppers, Adele was able to understand what it means to be a songwriter instead of just listening to the lyrics of other people’s song. For the inspiration of the song, Adele explained that it started after a fight with her mother about how she was convinced to leave home to go to the University of Liverpool.</p>

Adele explained that her song “Chasing Pavements” was about her first break up with her ex. The lyrics “Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements” can be interpreted as “Should I give up or just keep on trying to chase you despite knowing that I will fail”. Even though she was only with him for four months, she wrote about him because she hardly had any songs for an album. Before she knew it, she had already wrote 10 songs in just 5 weeks, all of which are about her ex-boyfriend. “I used him more than he used me. And he loves it.” said Adele.</p>

This album also includes a cover of Bob Dylan’s “Make You Feel My Love”. Her manager, Jonathan Dickins, was the one who gave her this idea. Although she usually avoid making covers because she felt like she couldn’t match with the original, she decided to try it. She did not understand what he was singing initially, so she looked up the lyrics. "I Google'd the lyrics while I listened to it and they were the most beautiful lyrics I've ever read, I've ever heard, I've ever sung." she said. </p>
