PROJECT PROPOSAL

  COMPREHENSIVE DESCRIPTION
  
  WEBSITE OUTLINE
  
  Our website will be composed of a homepage and four other webpages. Our homepage will begin with the header portion which will feature the website's logo and a navigation section with hyperlinks which will bring users to the four other webpages included in the website. The body of our homepage will show different sections composed of text and images which will be sectioned into Adele's life and musical journey, her awards and achievement throughout her career, her experiences and other topics about her. The footer will mainly cite the references and sources used for the text and images featured on the page through text.
  
 For the subpages, similar contents and layouts will be displayed for each. Like the homepage, it will also feature a header with the website's logo and a navigation section so that users may return to the homepage or visit the other webpages of the site. The content of the four other webpages wil describe information on each of Adele's four main albums: 19, 21, 25, and 30. Through text and images, each subpage will feature each album's tracks, inspirations, facts, cover art, and more information on the album. The footer sections for each subpage will also feature the references and sources used for the content in the specific webpage.
