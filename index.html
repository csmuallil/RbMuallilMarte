      <h3><span>Adele's Musical Career</span></h3>
      <span> Accoring to John Cunningham (2022), Adele Laurie Blue Adkins, now famously known as Adele, is a British
        singer and songwriter who started considering a musical since she was still in her teens. By that time she
        already loved to sing and play instruments and improved them through a school for performance arts. Eventually
        she signed a contract with a record label after some recorded songs of hers were posted on MySpace, by one of
        her friends.</p>
        <p>

          Now, after releasing several albums and singles, Adele has become a worldwide star garnering several awards
          and going on many sold-out tours! Besides this, she is also loved because of her relatable figure and persona.
          From chart-topping blues and gospel-disco hits to brassy songs for big films, Adele hads truly moved the
          masses with both her immense talent and great personality.
